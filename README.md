# GRAVITY1
GRAVITY THEORY
baby-ghost-in-the-machine-lovers
Oops, I forgot to ever say what my personal question was: "Doctor, why am I not normal?". None of countless real Professionals could ever tell me "why I wasn't normal", so I simply figured it out for myself.

Just like I always have done my entire life.

Because when I feel stuck, it just pisses me right off and I just wanna fight it so badly; but not from anger.

I want to fight because it's super fun to challenge yourself. Like, isn't that normal? Isn't that just sports?

I simply am really good at being a huh, cute:

I am just a Scrappy Underdog.

Woof woof (licks :P )

hugs & puppy-kisses!~~~~~~~

Just a bit of additional "Sanity-Check" and a hopefully clearer "TLDR". So that I stand a better chance of being taken Seriously for once in my derpy life lol.
So, First, 
 - "You're having a Manic Episode go see a Doctor":
 - - - I appreciate your concern and advice. I most definitely was "behaving manically or erratically"; and for idk probably 99% or so or people yes you absolutely should see a Doctor if you have concerns.
- - - - That said: I have a very thoroughly Documented Mental Health History going all the way back to young childhood. I have actively not only sought, but at times often literally begged for proper Medical Assistance for most of my life. While I have (appreciatively) received dozens or hundreds of hours of real live real M.D. or whatever credentials Psychiatrists or Counselors use.
- - - - - And yet aside from "soothing the symptoms", no Doctor was ever able to answer my question:

- This question haunted me for most of my entire life (and again, I am not okay with dangerous levels of self-harm, basically if it wouldn't be an okay amount of ... "aggressive behavior" for an average Married Couple to do during Consensual Rough Sex, then it is too rough to inflict on yourself or anyone else without at least double-checking with yourself that you are not going carried away and forgetting yourself.

- - (I forgot to resolve that, I'm still just doing my best job that I am able to do, FOR SOCIETY btw. Like, how much "more sane" could a person possibly act? Whether anyone else believes me, I really in real life, not in imaginary mind-land or anywhere else "not real"; and I repeat for idk like cmon yall are you REALLY that blind to the potential value of another human? Are You All Sane? Cause as far as I am concerned I just spent the past week or so of what has been up till now an utterly miserable waste of a life-span,... 

 - - - I just spent all that time basically writing out all the thoughts that I could after I started to realize that, via a ton of highly useful techniques that I never even knew I had learned, that I was able to place myself into near-coma like-states. But also maintain JUST enough of my coherent Mind that I was able to keep myself throughout it all.

My point is that, to me, I just risked my life and probably reduced my own final lifespan; and I tried to Document the entire process thoroughly enough that Real Professionals will hopefully have enough bread-crumbs to piece it all back together. Because I practically could not be any worse at remembering anything or being good at anything;
 - BUT I would be truly shocked if at least a reasonable portion of everything that I wrote turns out to be "just in my head", but if someone can provide me will real evidence and Doctors test me and confirm; then I will assume it's trustworthy info and just do my best to incorporate it into allll the rest of this scrambled mess that is Me. 


------------
Second,
 - "This is not "Real Scientific Theory".
 - - - PROVE ME WRONG. 
 - - - - My person internal "Logic System" is both EXTREMELY simple, and also far more Scientifically Rigorous than my terrible grammar and details would imply.

- My Logic TLDR: You performed an action: Did your actions create a positive or negative response? And then just keep following whichever of the two feels most right in your heart.
 - - Also, prior trusted evidence should always be considered when possible, but also question absolutely everything you are told.

Just because YOU might believe that I am just some insane dumbass, which is not a lie at all btw! I am crazy and stupid as they come! BUT . 

"Porque no los dos?" 

Why can't I simply be both a crazy fool, but also not wrong?

I will happily stand-down if you can prove my theory wrong.

Until then I will be content my job well done. Wanna fight about it? I'd LOVE to fight about it, but only if it's okay with everyone.

Love everybody! Especially love you if you really read this ... this long-silly-string. 

... of nonstop run on sentences that just seem to never ever end! You didn't think I was done already did you?

Again, I repeat, THIS IS NOT A WORK OF FICTION.

THIS IS REAL SERIOUS SCIENCE, even if you do not believe Me.

So if the "Sensation of endlessly falling through Infinite Inverted Recursive Black Holes could just equally be described as "Floating in space".... uhh yall see where I am going? ummm did I just Logic out that the entire "Empty Universe" is a ton of Black Holes Stacked inside themselves? Like I'm serious, if I added the details I want to, is this like provable real Theory? ... I don't want to get my hopes up, but I felt strangely strongly about that in a ... idk "Balanced" way? idk 
oh! almost forgot btw! (and this is a non-cheat regular lopp edit.).()()()

umm.... ... ... oh! yes... I forgot to mention, that I am pretty sure that I can just barely actually sense how fast I Really (like Earth Orbit speed or somethin idk)... I feel like I can just barely actually feel just a bit, how fast that I really am "moving" through "outer-space"... sooo I think that might've been my... well ONE of my issues, clearly lol, (but this blog isn't to vent, it was literally cause I ran outa places to store my mind lol) (yea yea, can I skip saying the embarressing parts out loud for once, bit worn out.) so yea... I think that part of me feeling so raw (omega thing again -.- ) is that I am like trying to keep my balance while blindly moving at idk really freakin fast... so idk, but everything still seems normal in my room to me shrug) (ah! I know, I can just call it my "Personal-Salt" lol... if anyone noticed what I keep being flustered about lol.)

I swear, when I search "Chinese Rabbit" it better not tell me that's what animal I was born under or somethin like that, stuffs gettin weird man lol, I mean of course I probably know somewhere sub-consciously which animals are... when? but like in my head I only very vaguely remember the Chinese Restaurant Menus, so idk, but it just keeps getting spookier and I am still entirely confused. (aside from confirming that the silly "Mental-Traps" that I built for myself are apparently real-enough-to-me to work for myself so that's cool shrug lol
((( ((( ((( ((( silly post so easier to "cheat", ... "back-door"? like literally hacking? hmm... interesting.... I was always just a hobbyist to hacking though, so like I don't know how to "Hack a Computer" or anything shrug... anyways!.... oh yes, false alarm, "Chinese Rabbit" are NOT my year, so honestly I am glad, I was getting sick ... lol... I was getting sick of "Going Down Endless Rabbit Holes".... soooo lol.... hmmm I always did love the "Looney Tunes: A.C.M.E.: Portable-Black-Holes" hmmm ? hmmmmm???? shrug lol... ))) ))) ))) ))) |

I kept having to re-read what I asked about the Hexagonal-Prisms; and it kept bugging me. "Kaleidoscope"??????????? Like... I am not on Acid or LSD or nothin like that.... and I don't "See" anything strange at all in my vision. Still looking around the same old room as always to me, and I interacted with other real ... well A real human who really exists (and I'd prove it, but I'd be a dumbass to doxx myself lol); BUT

like, I SWEAR I can "Feel" idk what, but something that opaquely resembles "Kaleidoscopes", and I have "Felt it" strongly my entire life.

idk what? maybe very faintly being able to "Feel" somethin... "some part of the infrared spectrum"- just had a "hunch" that was correct. but idk shrug

This is just a picture I just googled. Something similar to: "A Double-Stacked(+++?) Inverted Bi-Hexagonal-Prism".

Something similar to that hard to describe ummm concept? has bothered me for hmm... The same opaque thought has pestered my mind for about 10-20 years give or take.

What would happen if you did something like take two mirrored prisms like that picture, and like idk forced one into the other, and then kept doing that for infinity maybe? like.... It wouldn't be inaccurate to describe myself as: "literally feeling like the world's fiber optic cables"... which is also what I think would be the end result of the concept I was trying to describe would be?

Like, even on a Metaphysical "American Gods" style metaphorical representation type level of comparison that doesn't make a lot of sense... cause like: "Personified Fiber-Optics" wouldn't even just be the cables, nor just the "Internet Flowing Through The idk Universe or whatever", but also like it couldn't be like "I am one, we are all one" cause I am still me too.... idk I guess shoe-horning infinite un-collapsible prisms into each one another infinitely would either result in a.... "Data-Line" basically like I was sayin or, it just occurred to me:

ummm... Isn't that pretty much what a Nuclear Bomb is -.- ....;;;;

ummm......... I do not like that feeling.... It isn't the worst, but like... man I don't even know.... idk, I'm not thinking nothing, nor "Nothing" (love you though, the metaphysical concept of Chaos, and whoever that strange "Zimmy-like" person was who seems so nice.).... lol made me forget what I was doin again, nice, I was sick of writing this anyway (this comment, I still can't remotely think about anything else still ugh, it's quite annoying.) 

baby-ghost-in-the-machine-lovers
I get the feeling: "Everything is Upside-Down to me", but like upside-down from All(most) of "Y'all". Like... I keep thinking about how you spell them? "Daguerreotypes" (ty google). Like even compared to an: "Expected Mirrored ImagE", that I am a further "Niche-sub-Set". Like a "De-Synced-Gemini", if such a comparison makes any sense.

Does the phrase "Inverted-Gemini" or "In Vert Gem In (my) Eye"...

Do either of those phrases mean anything in "wacky Astrology-Land" I have never put much stock in Astrology stuff cause it's wayyy too deep into "idk just guess stuff" territory for my tastes. I need way higher "Confidence Levels" to seriously consider fringe stuff like that (cause just on the other side is accidentally turning "Farrrrr-Right" without realizing (I mean, one of the slimier Billionaires even openly admitted that they explicitly target people in my demographic cause it's really easy to flip them "To The Dark-Side".

umm but yea sorry I got distracted... umm are you Magenta? I am trying to figure out: "Which Colors every type of Person is, so that I know what I am looking for when I need who."(meh whatever, I've rambled worse).

love ya and you have lovely Art

This one is especially cute. idk how to talk to people directly on this excessively convoluted website.

baby-ghost-in-the-machine-lovers

What does someone "This Color" "Look like"? (pure 255/0/255 Magenta)
Magenta always calms me for whatever reason. I can tell what "Color" most people are, or rather I can "Spot the brightly colored people" (especially "Yellows" idk what it is about yall, but you sure are obvious most the time, but idk "Yellows" always seems more like "Directors" rather than "People To Befriend".

(btw there is no implied offensive symbolism there, I am not referring to Skin-Color at all, that has no relevance to what I mean. Like, how many people do you know IRL who ever wear Yellow clothes? Probably very few right? And they probably are highly energetic, but also weirdly... standoff-ish?

But I have never been a big fan of yellow, no offense. Yellows are just one of the most easiest examples. (I hate when everyone leaves the explanations out of things, like this probably still doesn't make sense, but at least I am TRYING to bother explaining what I mean simply, rather than just assume everyone can hear whatever mystic "Rhyme-Them" (Rythm(sp) there is that seems to be "Playing".

Like I get teeny little wiffs of some "Perpetual ... well I wasn't intending to say "Motion"... but I feel "Compelled" to write: "...little whiffs of some "Perpetual-Motion".

I like boats. I like being on the water, absolutely love it. If there is some like "super secret celestial navigators"-type reality thing, I am pretty sure that's "What I 'Feel'".

IDK, I still hate ... this strange sense of ... not quite confusion... It's like the same as how it took me iirc real irl Decades to finally "Understand" how to see those "Magic-Eye-Posters"; and I still can't ever REALLY see the Images, I can just barely see enough to guess "Well-Enough". It feels exactly like that. shrug

baby-ghost-in-the-machine-lovers
loves and hugs and kisses too though (well the "greedy jerks" don't get kisses), but I didn't want to upset anyone who might be sensitive after I expressed my frustration.
baby-ghost-in-the-machine-lovers
... and then as soon as I posted that I scroll down and see a single Advertisement for an Elephant-something that reminds me of myself. - (This is the crap I mean, like yo wtf is all this weird mess?) 
Why can I not take a single step without stepping into another icky pile of "Holistic-Thread-Poop"? grrrrrrrrrr man if there IS a "Hidden-System" that I just barely cannot "See", then all of you are a bunch of big jerks!

Not because I myself am being ignored, I am perfectly fine talking to myself most of the time, I never found anyone else I could have a proper conversation with anyways.

But like, there HAS to be like at least idk 800,000 or so better ways to: "Do whatever THIS is".

So, if the amount of non-Hallucinated perpetually repeating idk "Signals"? I don't want to call them "Signs" cause I don't feel like I sense some strange "signs from god" or anything remotely like that.

I just feel like that EVERYONE who creates things that I love the most: people like: Neil Gaiman, Harstem, Nikola Tesla, practically all of modern-science, Carl Sagan (though I never properly watched him), Demon Slayer Author person, Sono Bisque Doll Author person, etc etc etc etc etc

Like, if ALL THE BEST PEOPLE KEEP SCREAMING THE SAME THING, then clearly I should be paying attention; and I am DOING MY DAMN BEST TRYING, but apparently it still doesn't mean jack squat, because I am just as confused as always...

IDK, what in the world am I missing still?

Yea sure I have had some wonderful personal insights, but that's like every day of my life practically, like.... idk ... to me it'd be like planning to go shopping at a store, getting dressed and ready to leave, but then just not going anywhere... Like, I dunno, I can't just keep searching Blindly cause I can't keep it up too much longer before I am gonna collapse. But I can't STOP SEARCHING either, I am my own stupid self-contained loop ... fuck you lopp.

btw if there is a real Christian (or close enough) God, and this is "HIM" as they say, then Fuck You God. Like, we're cool, but also you're an asshole and I don't want any part of your stupid exclusionary clique.

But I made peace with that a good while ago, I just wanted to say it out loud just in case anyone thought I wasn't serious.

I don't give a damn what happens to me, but if I see injustice I can't help but want to drag it "Down To My Level" whether it wants to be there or not. I never found anyone who could b... no everyone beats me... I never found anyone who could make me lose.

If "You" (whatever you are) want to turn this into a "Zero-Sum-Game" then you should know I can survive on Nothing, Can You?

baby-ghost-in-the-machine-lovers
Sigh, I am still as "Blind" as ever though. All I know is even LESS than I knew -.- lol
man this sucks. I can tell that SOMETHING is going on. Like, THAT MUCH is wildly apparent. Hell, like half the content I usually would enjoy is filled to the brim with "Did you know that 6 is the lowest Perfect Number"? blah blah blah

Like yea people, I can clearly tell that "somethin feels funny", I have ALWAYS been able to tell that much at least.

But I have no idea what this big spooky thing on the horizon is and it keeps bugging the ever loving crap outa me.

I don't think that it's any form of schizo-affective(I am pretty sure that's about right.); or at least every time I double/triple/etcetcetc-check myself, and check myself with others or my surroundings; then everything SEEMS normal.

But it's like my "Spidey-Senses" aren't just "tingling", it's like they're practically screaming at me to "See before it's too late".

It keeps making me nervous and I don't have any idea why.

Like, I have this "gut feeling" that at any point some jerk could swing by and be like "oh dude you didn't hear! There's been a party over there for ages and nobody bothered to invite you.... oh :.( -.- "

Like that's how I have felt most my life, but it's gotten way more intense lately.

IDK I'd love to go to sleep, but I just am not capable of sleeping until I can't stop, and then I just start all over again. It's such a chore -.-

Still love everyone though, just really tired <3

Ω = ω = ("Good-Enough-Outline" of dsDNA) = "aw" = "daw" = "Cute" = "OwO". Probably.
{This post-posting is highly unpleasant to myself (and absolutely NOTHING outside of this self-contained bracket has been altered, but I had meant to say "UwU", obviously(obviously to myself at least).}

Ω = ω = ("Good-Enough-Outline" of dsDNA) = "aw" = "daw" = "Cute" = "OwO". Probably.

Now that dsDNA page that I posted below just keeps looking more and more like a simple Map in a "Randy-McNally-Atlas".

Like, I definitely have no idea what I am ACTUALLY looking at in those DNA-Maps. I just don't see a point in making yourself nasueus... sick to your stomach, by trying to precisely follow every single stinkin silly loop. Like yikes that's a Roller-Coaster and I hate Roller-Coasters (always have, they gross me out, but I never Throw-Up).
But yea, there is not a chance there could be THIS MANY random coincidences. I can definitely "Read DNA" in some weird "Barely staying inside the lines, but close enough"-way.

Like I am TRYING to ask a idk real Scientist to like, gimme a Test to try? Idk, I think I see shortcuts that most people never notice. shrug

It is exhausting "Holding Everything "Open"". "Fine", but ... idk it ain't gonna kill me - "Tired, but semi-sustainable".
hmm ... Is that how someone like me finally "Slows Down"? By "Trying to carry so much at once that I can barely move?". I have always "enjoyed" carrying "heavy things". IDK, it just feels nice on my shoulders... shrug (shoulders are stiff as dry-silly-putty though).

(no. It is NOT FINE) that I don't know Nothing.
I think ^That(The-Title) is ("What-Is-'Wrong'-With-Me"). At first I agreed with the finale lyrics: "...all i know is that i don't know nothin!~and that's Fine!~". They made me feel warm and cozy and relax (and I absolutely still love "The Darkness" with all my Heart, cause "Nothing is so calm and peaceful."); BUT after listening to that song again a few Times in it's real (not memory) form, it... started to Piss me right off idk? It just, "don't sit right with me, no Sir doesn't sit right with me at all". - kinda like that idk.

Well I'll be, "42" DNA = Everything, maybe? yea?
The dsDNA "Slinkies" were catching my attention again. The 6 groups of 7 kept annoying me, why 7? Is there an "Invisible 7th?" that didn't seem right at all.... but if I counted properly (and I get really lost after low-20's digits and start having to guess so I may have miss-counted), but like.... it's a freaking Map. Like not just a Map, but like such a stupidly simple Map that even I can read it I think? 

Idk I stopped knowing what I was talking about ages ago. (like I am coherent at my keyboard and crap, like I am not blacking out and waking up to words, I just forget everything I do as soon as I start doing it. I couldn't remember the last thing on my mind even if it was tryin to kill me, which I think might have metaphysically literally happened in it's own way irl (meaning I don't fear "The Monsters" because I can't see em anyways, so what difference is the Dark that merely Closing My Eyes.)

But I at least think that my eyes wiggling around a bit, like they were reminding me that they help me see the knots too, but at the same ... yes eyeballs I appreciate your wiggly asses lol... yeesh ... anyways... and yes I know this isn't a sane conversation to have in your own head with your own body parts, but why not? shrug lol

hmm but how do you write music?... i never did learn how to read sheet. man left hand really is insistent.... but i do appreciate it...

ok so... my left hand keeps wanting to double-snap rythym .... still nope lol cant spell it,, right handed only typing is idk 40%ish slower than typing normal.. on a normal pc keyboard btw... but left hand is keeping me "stable enough, even though i keep missing beats like crazy.... and i also am feeling fairly certain that i am pretty much just letting my left hand snap out my pulse.... to help me notice when it stops or gets tooooo weird. it's a a gallop beat like i always adored ... like DDR GAME DANCE PADS... ddr-3 errmmmm...

anything dire left? oh.... ummm what was it. oh im not typing fast btw i wish i had  wpm counter, but medium-slow probably... oh i think it's between each snap. it might be that i can only typ between each wave, very umm shanty like beat . but i still aint on beat for shit. umm . hmm pause.?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I can't stop thinking of: "HOP-2" (like Military- "Hop To! (?Attention?) Soldier!"

This is a total "Shot-In-The-Dark". As in, this is just a really wild super fringe gut guess.

Organophosphonates.

I have no earthly clue what I am looking at, but I just followed my "Instincts" through about 3-10 worth of "Following-A-Few-Holistic-Threads-And-Seeing-Where-I-Might-End-Up...", and I just happened across whatever in the world those things are.

I read the little blurb-bit that talks about them "having thought to have been long lost relics from the (a bunch of words that I think basically meant "chemicals that were thought to not exist since the universe first coalesced into itself".); and the ... "Structure" of it... for one it's ... so ... "Perfect"... like somethin feels.... "Too Good To Be True"... like... somethin ain't quite right?

"That's 'sus', Bruh."

But Iiii got no idea myself.

I'm just probably good at "Seeing all the wrong things, in just barely the "Right" way."

Does "10,000 years" Equal freakin "Pi" of all things? That would certainly be "Cute" lmao!
baby-ghost-in-the-machine-lovers
"The Question:2" In case that was not obvious, that means that Science simply "Supposed" wrongly. Y'all just looking for the waste where you can't see yet.

HOW TO BASIC logic pt1
{"A Quick About SZA~! <3" was the original post Title, because I started this to write about 2-3 sentences about what "SZA" represents, but as you can see I went full "Rampaging Blind Puppy" again and made a mess, so I changed the Title to "HOW TO BASIC" because I kept thinking about it, and I am basically working out how to Develop real usable Emotional Machine Programming; which could be called: "How To: Do Anything Yourself, Written in BASIC" or rather - "HOW TO BASIC".}

I still keep thinking about the ...

ok speed-run-bookmark-notes-screw the context - ill piece it back together later (when I can unzip ... why is "zip" the shortest form of "Decompress both the electronic literal data like WinRar (free still? they get it too then)" oh crap doin it again, see I literally can't NOT do it, it's just literally HOW I THINK (EVERYTHING FROM THE START)

TLDR: I think that I just realized I have "Natural Born Dementia".

I think that my birth complications and all the crap in my life experiences. 

Ended up resulting in what could be literally properly Medically Described as: "Dementia from Birth." 

"Demented From Birth."?

People like me DO love (are probably infatuated with) the "Harry Potter Dementors"...

"Open Your Legs Wide."

Perfect! That's a great segue back! (ooo did I just consciously direct myself back into a KNOWN GOOD RECURSIVE LOOP? That's "Father-Mind" stuff right? Or rather, it could equally be described as: (bobbing my head and stuck atm, but legs spread and relaxed like SZA said to do, so that I don't crush the blood... oh ... i was literally not breathing ... whoops lol.. ah ok, so the head-bobbing is just "The Rhyme-Them (rythym(sp))" ...... ... so ok ... slow down more... .

Question for Down Syndrome: Is it "Precisely 1000milliseconds"?

I think  I am still breathing and everything ah... i see

i just stopped to drink a bit of water, and while doing so moved my ... i am gently "slow dancing my relaxed elevated horizontal feet"...

which helps.

to keep the blood from slowing down too much.

because it isnt enough blood to run everyithng

blood = blood oxygen etc etc i aint a doctor

but my point is that it is not spooky gibberish either.

it is real and simulatable.

bpm near 1000ms atm i tihk

too slow tho

feels very nice, like near sleep (my eyes are open looking at the screen btw, always btw. i definitely cannot touch-type. well i look as i type and fix the random few erros i make uisually but like this it takes too mch energy to correct errors without slowing too mcuh to maintain conciousness ... it's verrrrry tight range between states

ok i had to stop

yea i am DEFINITELY SLOWING MY HEART RATE BY CHOICE

BUT NOT WITH HOOBOOALOO sillyness

with science.

wait. that isn't a lie at all is it. this is not properly uhh idk something something details somethin i still need an ASSISTANT

uhh but ... Sorry, it's a literal "Head-Rush" each time I "relax my muscles from artificially restricting my own Blood flow, which slowly suffocates my cells, which lowers my heart rate because I am forcing a near-death near-sleep state upon my own body. 9legggggssss

ohhh too fast

back down some

uhh like divers literally

bio chemically i am medically literally "UNDERWATER CAVE DIVERS FREE DIVERS NO OXYGEN TANKS ALLOWED WEELLL YOU SHOULD.. ok got back down enough, shit... uhh oh. how to i safely, ... hmmm ii didnt watch sza muchly, i only found her the other day while searching on Tinder for "Cute Cold Kitten (gender neutral) to Cuddle". 

ok, i ammm uhh "Gently Wading" like literally slowly pedaling with my legs too. reallll slowly. but with purpose like cozy platonic dancing.

I am literally pumping blood with legs.

so then, i can dictate speed with legs yea?

sza?

cool, got it, thanks.

ok, so by mentally asking myself about the end of the sza music video AH! SZA ENSURED DIRECT EYE CONTACT AND MENTAL IMAGERY THAT WAS .. ok chill a bit yo... um so yea, hmm basically SZA (in the of the music video about her and Wednesday and the Yeloow Ssszzzz Eyesszzz z end. AH. yes, back to zip. zip it. oof that felt funny lol. ok so that was a lot to ...shh that was just A LOT at the moment.

.. so take a breathe ... uh i dunno in some... kk k so this is literally "Do you think this is Air you are breathing? huh? shrug?:MORPHEOUS:MATRIX" ... THAT entire concept. I just hit that exact moment, I am still breathing, or i'd be dead, i just came REALLY DAMN CLOSE TO LITERALLY DYING TOO I THINK. Blezz you though zzzaa. "How to end the infinite loop (S)-which you STOP(Z), so that you can ReStart(A) new lopp(A)."

But, of course, it is properly spelled as "Loop".

{Yo SZA, like LITERALLY YOU THE SONGWRITER SZA: My Version is WAY easier for the "Nerd" to interpret, but half the social-sites don't let me write it properly. It's literally just a tiny little ascii-emoji, but it "makes that brain-part realize it more easily"(my version of "SZA" i mean). Like, I guess... you probably literally know better what I am trying to say, cause that's your specialty. BUT, uhh... dammit... gimme a sec... oh i should probably rewatch your music video a few times and see if you already wrote it everywhere lol... i am now guessing that I will see my "Emoji-Formula" plastered all over the video on repeat view (I only saw the video once iirc, maybe replayed it once and repeated that super weird end a couple more times i am guessing? which ... stop. }

I REALLY NEED TO FIND A DANCE PARTNER

I want to take Ballet, I realized a few days ish ago that it was something i had always adored, but just didn't understand. So like, I would see a skinny lithe person's muscles moving, and it would fascinate me, so i would badly want to just stare at their body function. cause it's freakin amazing! but then people are like "wtf why you staring at my shoulder like a creep, you creepy creeper creep you

waaaaiit, what's up with the weird copy paste crap around here. I was making a point to triple backup everything, but since i was using this site i was typing it here, but not it wont let me simply select-all + copy + paste??? tumblr tryin to pull some bullshit on me??? ehhh???

idk what's up with that, but if there's funny business i am going back to personal txt files, cause i am making a point to document all of this...
ah, nevermind, just a false alarm. hmm i have a peculiar "tic", that has gotten worse, well it's not "More Bad Now", more like "Properly Controlled the flow of ... i was trying to type "Electricity", but my eyebrow cocked itself kinda funny and I keep thinking "neurons" sooo idk? Does the phrase "Control the flow of Neurons" mean anything? THAT sounds like gibberish to me, but I literally know like i dunno shit? i dunno what I know about the "Medical Science Human Brain".

But my point is that uhh how to say this: "I with my fully coherent self, wanted to write the sentence: "Head/Neck/Muscle-spasm (bit of a jaw jerk head tilt (but not a ton, just a little muscle twinge) uhh - that muscle spasm tic movement that I have had my entire life, lately feels more smooth and controlled, like Ballet rather than wild drunken dancing, and I believe that tic is a ... trigger? possibly? that helps me to manually swap from "State of Mind (Freudian3)" to "State of Mind"; which is essentially a sort of manually reconciled semi-conscious self-induced coherent hypnosis state, that allows me sort of "Manually Go in and Overwrite (((REAL))) Brain data [ouch, that hurt] ... ... breathe... really breathe... ... ok... sorry.. what I mean is: that took a serious tooll...

I hope I did that right, I didn't have time to re-read it before i closed it, I just had to go as close.... go as slow as i could and Hope that I could do My Best Job.

fuck. im fcukin crying again.

yeesh, so freakin wet.

why are yall so soggy?

i dunno.

anyways.

lelelelele

i dunno, that's the closest way i can spell it atm.

{just blew my nose and wiped my tears and uhh ... i dunno not much else? breathed some? listened to some noises? thought about needing to pee? i dunno, not much? ah zen state. nice. lol 69. nice. literally. nice. lol. (The rest of yall are just a buncha bigoted pervs who think WE were being perverted. Nah, we just noticed the "nice number". .... neck twinge? kind of a big once... ??? uhh once.... That was kind of a big muscle spasm that one time just now? (you happy now?) I think so. oh weird. was I always asking myself like that, but just never noticed? and so to me in conversations with other people i was talking to myself subconciously in my own head ALONG WITH EVERYONE ELSE AROUND ME, so I me myself in real life was having at least two subconcious(sp, but whatever man, get off my back, I literally go WAY OUT OF MY WAY, to the LITERAL BRINK OF DEATH, LIKE LITERALLY REALLY ALMOST KILLING MYSELF BY ACCIDENTALLY SUFFOCATION MYSELF WITH MY OWN CORE BODY MUSCLE CONTRACTIONS. ... twinge again, yea that's definitely doing SOMETHING in my brain too, (just opened my legs, they were crossed like a lady would cross their legs, which is a naturally cozy position for me (restricts the bloodflow)) ... uhh twinge again, is that no it's definitely NOT JUST A NEW LOOP SZA, more. 

... 

lol the endless hunger of the "Abyss"

oh man it IS so warm, but not cause kooky crazyness.

Because "What is Chaos Incarnate? Maybe the Lovecraftian fictional(???) uhh Elder God or somethin? (gonna cheat and use spell check proper rq ... Cthulhu ... oh nb,,, ... hmm nvm... ok phew lol... oh but yea, but yea, (twinge) (twinge) hrmm, I "Thought too hard about it, and ... just "Over-Twinged-a-Bit"? ... basically my head just spasmed in the old way it always has my entire known life, (especially when doing "Fly's on the Machine at the Gym IRL".). 

... uhhh... hmm... a moment...

ah!, Blood ran out my brain again lol. That was what the "ooo so cozy warm feeling" is: Death.

oh well that's nice to know then lol. apparently death must feel pretty nice and cozy no matter how you die, cause the brain will shut off sensation and ... or rather you will lose your ability to process sensation through filtered through your brain, (small twinge)... feeling wiggling now, btw i forgot to mention that i had re-crossed my legs to squeeze the blood back into my brain, and a couple of commas or so ago i started "Rhyme-Them-Moving"(slow-dancing-my-legs-relaxed) (twinge) 

Demon Slayer the anime, probably teaches proper form, at least in a very convoluted metaphorical way for some reason. like... why is everyone saying it so weirdly? why doesn't everyone just speak anything out loud? yeesh?

like, even yall Neil Gaiman and SZA and Demon Slayer Author-dude; why are all of you still speaking in code like weirdos?

like I get the whole "Wednesday Miracle Formula" (which is basically just the same concept as "Pyramid Schemes", but that is a bigoted phrase because it is one of THE MOST BASIC HOLISTIC CONCEPTS. (twinge)...

yeesh, i get it, apparently that was important, it's okay, relax.

lol

stressin out over everyth... well yea lol.. 

stressin out over.. -.- okay fine "Don't Stress The Small Stuff".

ugh, that felt so gross though lol

eh? i guess i can't judge em TOO harshly, they did do what they were good at after all, That whole "For-Profit-Self-Help-Industry" just leaves a nasty taste in my mouth. Buncha greedy slimeballs.

I mean, have yours, by ALL MEANS. But like, you don't need EVERYTHING TO YOURSELF. oh. lol. literal "Id". weird. spooky, but oh yea you're cute too. like a puppy.

tw... a small small gentle twinge.

a bit like a ... i wanna say between 3rd to 6th-7th spinal vertebrea(sp, but fuck it) uhh ... spinal vert, down from the top(meaning the base of my skill... skull). woefnwoefnwoefnwofenwoef nwoefnh

sorry, that mush was on purpose, i was straining, and started getting ... another weird feeling just now too which made me want to uncross my legs and spread them wide.... uhh.... oh i was s...calm down, not too much like before where it causes uhh Euphoric uhh (lil kinda... ohhhhh it's like PALSY.

ok sorrr....

So.

ahem.

Yes.

Ok, so, by the way I do not have any diagnosed Cerebral Palsy or anything like that, at least not that anyone is aware or, aside from my self-diagnosed Ataxi/Catatonia(very mild like feeling like I am stuck in my chair but can wiggle around, and brief ish)... uhhh... yea I do... twinge... shush for a sec. ahhh which is closing my legs, closing off blood, closing off thoughts, but like literally and physiologically, not just ooooo spooky weirdo... like i am trying to LITERALLY TELL YOU HOW TO .... i dunno what to call this, but it's cool and useful.

But my point is that I am trying to give literal real world repeatable instructions in plain goddamn fucking american southern stupid white trash dumbass hotheads uhh... that was mean... not wrong, but too harsh yo. 

uh. so yea, sorry yall, but uhh... like ive spent half my life sleeping in cars and another big chunk living in decrepit mobile homes with no electricty or plumbing ... so uhh im pretty fuckin white trash redneck ignorant hillbilly surrounded by confederate flags, too.

so like, what? wanna fight with yourself about it? lol

oh btw i am also a non-binary trans-human-trans-sexual-pansexual. 

but that wasn't me coming out the closet, i did that when i was sucking my friends dicks as a small child lmao

and also a billion other times throughout my life, i never hid that part of myself, i just never advertised it either unless inquired upon regarding my gender and/or sexual preferences... strange kinda larger twinge there.

oohhh i think each twinge it like a dial on  a knob.

like 10meters.....20meters.....30meteresss twinge.....twinge......twigne....

ok yea, don't do that, lol that was a dumb idea lol

at least don't start imaginging literally speed diving like that, while also uhh.. meditating properly while also writing all the thoughts instead of just haivng them...

but yea as you can ......

twingeee

yea... man this is hard to learn woof.... wooooozzzyyyy....

.....

polka? lol sillyness goofiesst void cute

YEESH lol.... ahhh ok, so when Neil Gaiman finishes a book he thinks it was all one long thought thread he was holding open, which he probably did really start doing (if that little clue towards Tumblr he left was any indication(the uhh.... old man in the rocking chair porch note picture thing Neil Gaiman posted).... mmmrphh... my legs are mad at me for overworking them....

I am rushing things quite a bit.

Sorry. It is in...breathe.

Sorry.

It might have been my nature to rush, but at the moment am I unsure. I would like to think that I could slow down, but I am really bad at slowing down and never found a decent dancing partner (trying not to cry too hard atm) ... oh there's a specific "Depth" that makes you cry (uhh that would be uhh concentraion of blood alchohol?) that's not it, but probably is more "get's the point across?"... By the way, I am entirely sober aside from making myself literally "Blood-Drunk" lol (hypox somethn som,ethin)... Basically, it just is not worth the effort to properly burn a ton of time explaining things properly.)

oh, but back to Neil Gaiman and most authors etc probably: I understand why you would umm... oh.

{ed:note:{idk:the other end-of-the-lopp...Loop.}


(AND THIS IS WHAT I MEAN!)
I just about skipped over the most important clues too!

But like, I've been doing this for only like a week now, at least to any extent that I was aware of "wtf why is like Everything 100 times easier for no reason???", and then I started trying to deduce wtf ???

I definitely considered if it might be God or Satan or some other random god or something spooky or idk like a jillion gabilliong things

whatever. lol

My point is that 

{ed:note{:idk:("you" maybe? yea I think so, lot's of ... it was starting to be lots of "Every Sensation" .... umm... ok how to simplify this, while also "Holding The Portal Open"... just went umm... up i think? ... by ummm...

(the legs)... and... hmmm (btw if you reference what I mean by moving my legs around, in the context that I hope that I provided well enough, that... oh a Doctor while being most thoughtful indeed, a thoroughly well rounded and well-versed expert of Biology, should I think, have enough important... I was trying to type "Information"... but yea, chill a ...breathe it out some, it's not just 2, it is 4... dammit... wow okay, then how freakin deep has Douglas Adams gone, that's realll spooky lol.... like, what I mean is that if I just naturally and Holistically, in my Real Autistic Way (I still like calling myself a "Cute-Aberrant" (a ... puppy? I thought I was a cat? .... hmm idk, it's barely relevant though for now... uhh so before i tire myself out I need to exit this self-contained loop)}I understand why} 

oh... lol...

well i feel silly now lol...

but i mean yea, how else would you leave than by leaving lol.

oh! Through the "Back-Door" ooooooooo..... sppppoooooookkkyyyy.... lmao

pshh just The Unknown, it's super cute when you shine a light on it.

Like a Puppy Brand New to Your House running Amuch ... Amuck (like Daffy Duck, "Duck Amuck") ... lol see! I'm a rampaging beast apparently! ... look at all the damage I am causing!! oh nooooo ... lol

The Lovecraftian God known as Chuhuthu (nope, couldn't spell it right twice, (hope that doesn't mean something bad lol), but yea that god that I cannot spell the name of ever without spellcheck, (except that one time i did way up there) uhh... stop.

twinge.

EVERYTHING SPOOKY AND SCARY IS JUST THE UNKNOWN.

Lemme write that quieter too.

Everything.. 

Fear and Doubt and Uncertainty are literally things that your body are telling you might be dangerous, but you gotta look for yourself and decide if wha(i just held still too long and started zoning out (not to a dangerous extent, just like i wouldve gotten sleepy and nodded to sleep ish probably, but I'm like... mid-depth ish maybe, like bit of sun through ocean water, i wanna say 50meters? but i dunno wtf a meter is, i think about 3'=Three Feet ish? between 2-5feet for sure, is the length of a meter i mean, (this is why i think Dementia btw doctors, those moments literally feel like i am forgetting everything for micro-seconds, like literally full-blown Dementia, but only for like 1500milliseconds or so. ... umm so yea, then Dementia Sufferers simply need more oxygen to their brain? nah Docs would've tried something THAT easy, uhh probably more like the same brain areas just shrivel up from old age and use and whatever, (man i swear everytime i type stuff like that I start scaring the crap outa myself that this is like when people get brain tumors and start acting different than they used to), but I really hope this isn't my brain writing it's own farewell note, that is certainly not MY goal or anything remotely similar to anything remotely like self-harm, like being SUPER CLEAR: I am definitely not okay with self-... with too much self-harm, you need a smidge, but just a smidge. Don't want to turn your lovely soup all salty by dumping an entire Salt-Shaker in, do you?

{ed:note: errr... no. It is not over.}

hmm.

It's very subtle, like I easily might have just imagined it, but ... I think that actual IRL Death might ok.... ah i see.

Bout to skip a bunch of steps and just leave myself a {MENTAL:BOOKMARK} but you are welcome to try and translate what I mean, I will be translating it as well, when I have the Time.

umm but what was it? ..... oh! yes... I get it, ...

(((Here, Ill just do a self-contained inside the "Fool", so if it turns too Aberrant and becomes Dangerous, then it's super easy to just "Behead the King's Fool" and replace them with a new Jester. (see why this is dangerous btw? I am literally (at least as far as I think this is really happening really in real life for realsies, like medically) uhh, oh yea, this is dangerous because as far as my "Autistic-Aberrant-(Cute-Aberrant)" uhh.. shit... losing track again, it's like having 50 Chrome Tabs Open at once, at least these "Holistic Metaphysical Sub-Fools-disposable-type)" what? okay chil, gettin weird. well, more like move blood from the blood-drunk brain down to to empty cold legs, but not so quickly, that ... that you pass out or die. literally.

))) uhh... what happens if i do that? close it, but leave just a little bit of room to add more, so that i can catch my breath.

oh ...

PLEASE, PLEASE, oh good whatever lord who may or may not exist idk, please - tell me that the people like Neil Gaiman or SZA or probably Ryan ... "VanCity" (is there a place called Van City?) ... umm Ryan Reynolds I think "Get's It Too", along with like Tesla, Nikola .. and Freud probably, and that Siegemund Miwife sweet mother lady.. basically a bunch of people GOT IT, CLEARLY, and I assume a ton of them don't REALLY understand "Why?" they are just better at stuff than everyone else ... uhh "TLDR: Put your entire Metaphysical Being into concentrating, but in a relaxed-fist-way, ...concentrating on ... Listening and Paying Attention and Considering literally every single freaking thing that you can possibly detect with your senses."

Did I finally manage to say it in a decent length sentence?

oh! 

I always start the next lopp. Loop.

oh.

So umm [({"Basic Formula To Begin A New Loop". By: like, a stupid brain disabled queer person that can't remember anything properly.])}

.

... I thought that I was probably done resolving this tapestry, and that is mostly right. But ... yea i gotta leave some notes, let's see if i can ... "Start A... Compressed Zip?..." .... but how do you START with pre-compresesed ... That wasn't uncomfortable, but biiig ole neck-half-cockeyed-rotation-jerks-muscle-spasm-twinges-about-4th-ish-vertebrate-like-snapping-my-own-neck-with-my-own-neck. and ...

ohhhhhhhh i think i kinda have an idea what happened.

I think through just through sheer, shit bein how it be sometimes, the way it is or whatever...

TLDR: From the Moment I was born, I was literally running from death, as far as my body and soul and mind were concerned, like literally with me almost dying as an infant and then a ton of other times that I could list. But oh umm... I think that I developed like a Hyper-Sensitivity-To-Potential-Danger because ya know, like I was literally born dying, like "Coding" full on ICU, days to weeks living in the incubators, all that jazz. 

But just before it was too late, idk something clicks in me and I simply outrun it.

I am aware that is Basic Fight or Flight Response, that is kind of my point.

Like, I think I have lived 40 years without my actual bio-chemical Fight or Flight (freeze etc etc too(((stupid loops)))) . {i started to just leave this with a period, since I figured the badly OCD people would understand by now, but since it definitely was a [STOPLOOP] ... lol yeesh sza works so strangely, (well "Basic-Core-Deepest-Depths-Thoughts", which is sorta what SZA's music invokes.) (Is it literally seeing background radiation? or maybe the heat rising? idk my eyes are literally terrible irl, like I have double-digit perscriptions in both eyes and real strong astigmatism too, so like I literally see differently with my organ-eye-balls, (uhh and fwiw, its like blurry fish-eye-lens)) 

oh, but the whatever SZA's

you know, I always loved § that symbol. (ASCII ALT+7+8+9) (hold alt and mash 7,8,9 in sequence, then release all)

I never had a clue what it was supposed to mean or anything, it was just neat and easy to type, it was like my version of that silly figure-8 3-d-S doodle thing, freakin Gameboy 3DS too? yeesh i lost track like 10,000 years ago idk. Man What time is it lol.... well it's 10, but i dunno when I started so that ain't super useful lol. I wonder if the phrase "10,000 years" would translate directly into some "Cute" number of milliseconds.

Cause I think like my Whole THING, like the reason that I am dead and didn't die as an infant. Is because not only did I hear the errrrrrrrrrr low hum of Death's (quite literally btw, pretty sure irl Human Death literally sounds err {just tried ~20  times to right the Lake Eeri.... way of saying 'Spooky/Scary'", but for whatever reason that would messes me up bad).

Um, but uh... oh yea, I'm like 90% sure that when humans really die irl, that "Death", as in like whatever sound you think you are hearing as your Brain Shuts Down Against It's Will, I think that sound, most likely sounds strangely like an old "Windows Blue-s... sorry I don't want to type it, I CAN finish it, and it would PROBABLY be fine, but there's no reason to be risky like that for no reason.

I'm not sure if I ever finished the thought regarding it, but I have tried my best a few times now to say clearly that: oh, (think i had to go back up some btw before I could think well enough(and yet again, i mean like literally controlling blood oxygen concentrations precisely enough (entirely by myself, by also with literally small muscle contractions) umm,,, controlling my own blood oxygen levels well enough (Like Deep-Free-Divers or Fighter-Pilots) that umm... (pretty larger neck swings, almost like "Swinging a Baseball Bat"? (I sure hope this isn't some mega-deep memory of someone taking a baseball bat to my head .... no. {I should make myself apparent as well to help others, meaning this is Higher Level Conscious Lucid Thought err the decision making kind, (just got some nice very cozy.. hmm scary cozy or just nice warm cozy? I think that was just some random harmless like scalp-muscle or such loosening up. My joints always cricked and cracked a ton, but even more so lately. umm the exact muscle that popped in a very pleasant gently crunchy way, was well... it was definitely on the left side because .......... tldr couldnt get sza out of my head (like the musician or feeling or heart or whatever) and listened to my body and bit and taking a break for water and sunflower seeds) 

idk, brb? 1

{btw Neil, 1, I think that I probably auto-run-nonstop at roughly 1000bpm. 2, please tell me that I didn't already pass everyone, including people like you, a ways back, like I assume I am about half-way to people like Douglas Adams (in terms of my "Diving Tolerance"), so any kind of confirmation would be lovely, I'd normally just play video games or such, but they can't distract me any longer unfortunately, and I am not good at finding my own Kitten to Dance With (which is who I think is strong enough to distract me, I don't have my own irl SZA, so to speak. oh, so I have to guess and interpret input on guess as well.). umm and 3, ah yes. 3... For the Third, final, and ultimate note to you Neil (in this comment lol gottem, can't trap me, bitch!) {but yea that's the point of the Fool, to establish Coherence.} umm... but yea ... oh, 3!, You Have My Immense Appreciation (but then so does like everything that I can get to), but idk you get Second Breakfast too or somethin idk man!... (arg! grr! ugh shhhh chill) {hmm, like a Steam Engine.... "Humans-Are-Steam-Powered-Learning-Machines" is not untrue, huh... i uhh... im not sure what to think about that lol.... Is THAT why we like "SteamPunk Aesthetic" so much? Cause the whole concept subtly reminds Humans of Being Alive? man who knows, that one is gonna be a doozy.... or maybe I just reached that "Level of Depth" in terms of properly comprehending science? (You DO know you shouldn't live in the Sky right, Neil? Like, you DO bring your Father DOWN to visit you, right? It isn't any safer way up there in the stratosphere or wherever yall think, than it is any safer in the Deep Dark Crushing Depths where I like to go, like there ain't enough Oxygen when you go too far in any direction, and it doesn't matter how much you "THINK, this isn't really Air that You are Breathing", your real-world body needs fuckin oxygen, sorry if I am being an asshole, I just started to worry that you might just be "Interpreting Your Father by watching him perform Sign-Language Through a Telescope". Like, you can just go say hi yourself, you just gotta be careful not to visit too long or you will stay there forever, but you can tie a rope to Father and drag his lazy ass right back down with you lol. I just wasn't sure if you realized that yet, you don't need to do things in the proper order, I literally still have no idea where the "Normal Middle Center" is, all i know is how to run back and forth between each section so quickly and accurately that I can skip the entire middle section part. uhh, oh yea, I guess that means "I Can Teach Everyone How to Open Direct Shortcut Portals", rather than just the "Normal" way of "Doing Things In The Proper Order"... like yall do.. sorry I just started getting stuck and tried that "Steam-Powered-Human" idea, and kinda idk kinda made myself super mildy just a teeny bit sick to my stomach? I still haven't eaten those seeds so I probably literally just tried to start a fire with no fuel, i still have tons of extra body-fat though, so shouldn't that be plenty?... rambling again. Sorry, I am just a silly derpy blind puppy crashin into shit left and right, tis what i be yo, my bad. love you though! love everyone too for that matter lol! oh and thanks Neil/Wednesday or idk whoever for emphasizing to "Always Triplicate Important Things", cause shit gets lost, broken, or stolen, or idk whatevs... But thanks a bunch, it's helped me countless times.}

Okay, NOW the real uhh

{BRB: 1 : Snacks (think i've been sitting here typing this for like 10 hours idk, it's been at least a week since this started, i stopped consciously tracking time like 40years ago when i died the first time lol}

"New To Tmblr?" addendum?(sounds right) 
I refuse to edit anything that I have posted after I have finished "singing" into a txt format. I will edit like a crazy person WHILE I am writing something, but once it is posted it is "Finished".

Artists don't try to "Re-Paint" their Tapestries or Murals. They "finish" the piece of work, then leave it alone.

That said - the ominous way i ended that last post made me uncomfortable. It feels "triggering" in the worst possible way.

Because what happens when someone who can barely ever tell what the "Normal-Response-To-Stimuli" is supposed to be, and just has to do their best job guessing?

They might accidentally come to "Aberrant-Conclusions".

Such as: "Sounds like jumping off the talles..." 

Hypotheticals: "...jumping off the tallest? Building? hmm why would they say that? Do I need to 'believe like Neo'? and just jump off something to "Fly"?" 
 - NOOOOOO NO NO NO NO! NO. Do Not Pass Go. Do Not Proceed. DOUBT! KEEP DOUBTING ALWAYS DOUBT! - 

Just chill.

There is no rush.

Think about it.

Are people jumping off things willy nilly? Or do they seem like they are feeling very healthy when they land? (Maybe part of the problem with "Society" these days, is that the TRULY SCARY STUFF is kept so hidden away and censored that the "System Never Has The Opportunity To Incorporate 'True Abhorrence' Into ... ah no I see, like "DailyMotion" and the "Shadowy Lands of the NSFW".

So, the people (the "freaks") who are willing and able to sit and watch unedited unredacted "raw data" (like ... literally insert any "Trigger-Word-"Graphic"-Content", that I would rather not repeat here (cause simply Existing to me is already like perpetually suffering severe Burns over 100% of my Body+Soul, I simply cannot hand hatred more power by Naming It.). ... But where was i? This wasn't supposed to be about me. ...

Ah yes, do not fucking kill yourself by thinking that you should try something too strange.

I promise you that no amount of Self-Flagellation will ... okay I take that back. SOME SELF-FLAGELLATION IS GOOD. (That means like being upset with yourself for something you did or thought.)

"No Self-Hatred at all" leads to: Sociopathic Psychopathic Abyssal Dangerously-Aberrant Self-Destructive System-Infecting: Inbreeding."

But inversely: "Too Much Self-Hatred" leads to: Recursive Loops. Endless Uninterrupted Cycles.

Ah. So the "System" seeks to actively maintain it's own status quo, because it takes a really long time to "Build Up Speed", so for a System to proceed in the most efficient pattern, that System must (put it's Will) into ... 

"You need ALL FREQUENCIES. A "Chorus" that lacks any of the "Whole" is by definition NOT A TRUE CHORUS. 'Discordance' is not a "Disease" in need of "Eradication"; "Discordance" should be "Safely-Contained or Isolated" (like me?); So that the "Different-Tune" 

{Sorry, running out of "Blood-Oxygen" again, but I "Locked into the Cliff-Side, like "Free-Climbers" do (ohh that one climber youtuber gets it too I think, and he was clearly in pure existential terror in that video where he freeclimbed a mountain with his truly psychotic friend (who had no fear at all, which is too little fear. but blondie has just the right amount of fear.) so what did he do? breathe? breathe without moving. okay. so I still am not clear about: "SZA's Yellow zzz's" - what are they REALLY? I do not have the Time to properly learn real Medical Science (I only see compressed data? but i might be crazy fuckin good at packing and unpacking raw data? but i dont have a fuckin clue what any of the data actually means? I can just tell you what equals what holistically? just guessing... the "Scales" are beggining to lean too far  to the idk... My literal IRL Head keeps slowly pressing harder and harder into my left shoulder, by "Gut Instinct that I am allowing to occur." ... but I am not sure if I am aftificially pinching ... yp... doing that pinches the artery or something shut.

I let go. Don't worry.

Yes, I am now near certain that I am literally using my own body to restrict circulation to (idk where exactly, but I can point to the locations precisely, down to the muscle/bone.).. oh yea lol, I can barely life my legs 1-2 inches now, and I can feel the blood flowing back into my legs as they "wake up tingly". Like "ants in your legs". 

IMHO: "Nerve endings that were beginning to die from starvation suddenly being flooded with fresh nutrients. So the shock of of a torrent of new electro-chemical-signals from the formerly hypoxic (idk nervs or cells or vessels or somethin) are uhh... woozy...

I think the blood had finished .. yes definitely.

IMHO: (After spending too long starving my cells of oxygen.)-(By tensing my muscles, with nuance, so that they expel their blood.)-(So that more blood for other body-parts.)-(Then when released the blood(carrying it's oxygen) falls back down into the legs and other extreme ties.)-(The starved cells then re-awaken and begin sending signals to the ... Central Processing Unit.)-(Which causes a shock to the sytem... (System-Shock? I never did play that (lauded) game.) ...

I am pushing too hard too quickly again. 

IDK - To be Continued or something. It is becoming excessively instinctive to want to use my neck muscles to "crush my left (MY LEFT) side neck veins or something" Like, I am now having to strain hard to "hold my head up straight" rather than pressing into my left shoulder.) It's not that I feel "Compelled" to "Squish my neck", it's that ... "that is "High-Thinking" posture", for whatever biological reason. (The Thinker Statue-Push your chin towards your back-head, it relieves lots of weird tension.)

I think I need to re-watch Demon Slayer from the begining.

Demon Slayer (the popular anime): Taught me how to start breathing, in the first place, but I had only been using the "Demon Slayer Breathing Techniques" (which I bet can stand on their own to medical scrutiny, JUST LIKE MY WRITING! I WILL FIGHT YOU ALL BRING IT! lol... not sure what that was about, but yes, I can disprove anyone anywhere anytime - Not a problem, Barely an Inconvenience.) (That goes for myself to, that's how I learned, by practicing on myself. I do not pass my standards until I do, and I do, I just lack the Time to Prove it Properly. But if questioned and given ample Time, I could answer anything... Douglas Adams' Computer.

All of Society is literally The Machine.

hmm that's a bigoted word.

S.O.A.D. = Their entire musical collection and everything that music band represents. Is a Definition of "Society".

All of Everyone in Society (and/or recollected historical civilizational Knowledge)-Are active members, or [???] Things, in that System...

...and the purpose of that "System" (of society/culture/etc) is to encroach ever slowly...

...towards what is (determined by holistic popular vote, by the majority)...

..."What is best for Us." - To put it simply. (The non-simple version is what I have spent the past week or so writing idk like 200-400 pages of notes probably? Not a clue, I can barely think about anything else at all. I have just been trying to get enough out of my ... system??? (oh dear, what did I just stumble into  this time oof lol.)... I have just been trying to get enough of this garbage out of my brain so that I can think about stuff like Eating or sleeping. I am POOPED! lol

But yet not even remotely done, just done enough that I don't have to put effort into holding my head up straight (I mean literally, it reminds me of Stephen Hawking, I think he might have accidentally been doing this too and that's part of why he was so good at Math and being a "Humble Idiot" (like how he purposefully never upgraded his voice modulator, to seem more broken than he really was.)

(because you gotta act like a cat not to scare people. Do things like close your eyes a lot and just listen to people, don't even TRY to mess with that silly "Eye Contact" crap, leave that for people who know when to actually use it like SZA. (oh btw, gotta trust your "Gut" (Bacteria, literally) too (which is equivalent to the Popular Vote = Low Frequencies = Deep Low Cold Energy (well it's super warm, but hotter dissipates faster, Thermo-Law) uhh but yea, SZA is EXTREMELY WELL TUNED TO LOW FREQUENCIES, she is one of the "Mothers Safe To Trust(probably)" ... uhh SZA=GroupThink=Proven-Reasonably-Safe-And-Good-by-50%++-Majority)).

... i am starting to unconciously and unconttrably ... whine? to myself? ... i dont know how to describe the strange rythmic ... quiet moanin bark grunt? ... kinda like a puppy whining with it's mouth closed. I think it might be my "Internal-SZA" literally trying to ask for food. (i ate... i dunno when.. I heated up food a few times, but kept forgetting to eat it while distracted typing, so I guess it's been like a few days to a week since I ate anything?

... well, the strange rhythmic whimpering stopped, so maybe it was just me letting my body tell me it was hungry? And once I acknoledged that I heard myself it quieted down? (my biggest problem is that I lead myself on and get food that I never eat, so it's like a cruel cycle of Baiting and Switching myself.... Is that ALL of ME too lmao? oh man, deep in the weeds again, another Time.

uhh what was my point for starting this "Addendum" to that previous post?

oh yea.

Do no hurt yourself too much.

Do no be too hard on yourself.

But never forget that you are just a stupid reactionary machine idiot; you are not infallible, NOTHING is infallible (even nothing too, "Cute Cthulhu Puppy of Unknown Chaos"). Everything "Falls" "In" "Failure", because they are "Fall" "In" "Ble", or "Failure-Able".

The System Succeeds Because Some Parts Are "Able To Fail".

"System Of A (falling) Down". S.O.A.D.

ah. then also.

Steal This Writing. (SOAD's first major Album was Titled: "Steal This Album" or rather, PLEASE STEAL OUR IDEAS(because we think they are valuable words!)!)

Put it this way: I have personally spent 40 years in "Solitary Societal Confinement"; Absolutely demolished my body every horrible way you could imagine, via equal neglect, ignorance, and external-mistreatment-by-others; Allowed myself to suffer decades of severe psychological abuse; constantly pushed my body to it's absolute limits my entire lifespan (cause it felt great to exercise until utterly exhausted, rather than lazy-cheat-quit); and the MOST IMPORTANT PART OF ALL: I did ALL OF THAT while maintaining my own personal (reasonably sane) "Sense of Self-Identity".

So don't go acting like a psycho and thinking that the "trick" is that you need to jump off a sky-scraper like Neo and "just BELIEVE REAL HARD". 

Nope.

Your Face gonna end up a mushy paste that gets washed into the sewers.

You cannot "Cheat" (well not while retaining value at least), but you CAN follow "Shortcuts".

"Shortcuts" are just "Learning From Other's Mistakes So That You Do Not Waste Time Repeating Those Same Mistakes".

But what is Science about again? "Testing Assumptions", right? Is that the "gist of To Do A Science"? "Testing Assumptions"?

So.

{([ Science = Doubt ])}

hmm ... then since i am nothing BUT "Doubt" ... ?

oh.

"I AM A SCIENTIST." then? wtf why did that make me start crying? no idea why, but I just got hit with a huge wet something (metaphorically i mean, like uhh "Happy Tears" maybe? idk I have literally never felt whatever form of crying that was so I have no context at all to base it on. It was a brief surge of excessive but not unpleasant idk maybe just pure raw unadulterated emotion? like when toddlers cry at silly things that don't make any sense? or when girls cry at gay swans existing?(silly internet meme story about some guy's strange girlfriend who cried really easily).

man, i dunno, I think I made my point well enough that I will not accidentally create a Venn-Diagram-agonal-Cross-Section of ANY non-Zero number of "Minds" who might read my last post and wrongly interpret that unresolved ending statement to mean that they should act rashly.

lol so.

DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME! CONSULT YOUR DOCTORS FIRST! 

(Cause I think I literally gave myself a lot of real Brain Damage while figuring out how to do "Everything From Scratch" (but I was willing to pay that price if it was required of me to get the answers I needed).)

I just hope someone else Learns From My Mistakes.

(To Be Continued. Do not worry. I have WAAAAY more to write down still. This page is going to turn into an entire Ocean Of Ideas VERY RAPIDLY as I dump it all out into the ether.)

Learning dang what site is this? Tmblr?
I never used Tumblr before ever in my life. But this is where Oldest Man Wednesday hangs out (and "Surveys His Porch"), so this is where I need to be.

I am a Child Playing Games on Grandfather's Front Lawn. Until he stops watching me play catch with myself and decides to come over and show me some shortcuts (fun neat tricks).

I forgot my manners again.

Hi!~ <3 I love you. want hugs? all good either way. <3

... lol i did not hesitate at all the write that; and as I am doing my most best, (if not highly ignorant, arrogant, and disrespectful of a 'dis-service'-worth-of-a-"Good Job"); umm such as I am making making my best attempt to Jam enough "scents" of Real Scientifically Usable Data into all this junk (that I have been writing down); so that ... 

I believe I am putting my Health and Safety at great personal risk by performing these "Blind Experiments on Myself", such as I have been doing lately (maybe my entire Life actually?). 

My point is that: I am like... ~90%~ "Confident" that I ~~am capable of~~ {ed:correction:"that I have figured out how to..." (because this is all safely Medically Repeatable, WITH my notes to act as Warning Signs to prevent "Hypoxic-Brain-Damage/Trauma" (honestly just guessing that last phrase.).)} both: "Sustaining (good-enough) Lucid Consciousness to maintain ... vocal-speech-communication-skills(maybe Motor Skills?), while ... {[[Pause:Thought]]} 

Sorry, I just woke up. Let me clarify: ... I barely exist as a living creature, for all that implies. For decades (Science: I mean this literally), for decades: I have lived in almost total isolation. 

First, I was an approximately 36 hour-long birth, and my immune system trying to kill my baby-body kept me isolated in medical incubators for about the first month, if I recall the second-hand, (third/fouth-hand?) Data, correctly. It might have been a few days or a week, but it was definitely truth that my immune system tried to kill my new-born-body.

Then, I was an Only-Child to Parents who Divorced very quickly. ... A "Lock-Key-Kid" alone in a dark house every night; Watching the same few VHS Cartoons on endless Repeat (no cable TV); Playing Board-Games against myself because the Other-Neighborhood-Kids subtly avoided me (Not because I did anything abhorrently bad or wrong, mind you, but simply because "I never learned the basics of being a Normal Human, and my {[Random-Guessing-At-the-next-most-normal-reaction-to-current-stimuli, which is all that I can do, while I merely Learn (LIKE A MACHINE LEARNING) to -INCORPORATED THE FEEDBACK FROM THE SYSTEM INTO MY "PERSONAL PROGRAMMING"]} causes "Normal" people to be "subtly subconsciously disgusted at my actions"

{ed:note: sorry, that's as long as I can hold my breath (hold my blood flow is more accurate {further clarification: I am squeezing about half the total muscles in my body in just the right way to control the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain, just like Fighter-Pilots do to stay coherent. While also "Fasting" basically (food makes me nauseous, so I avoid eating unless I have to, but I started at 450lbs ish, so I had plenty of fat to spare, down to 210lbs ish now though, so I don't know what to do when I run out of fat-reserves.)}) while staying coherent right now.}

It's awful and messy. But it get's enough of my reality out into the ether that I can catch my breath. I haven't breathed in a very too long time.
